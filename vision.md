#Vision Statement

JawsGame at its core:

* One player, the shark, competes with another player, the hunter Quint. When they end up attacking each other, only one survives.

* Before then, the players are hunting from the same pool of fish. They must strategize against each other—there is numerical strategy as well as mind games.

* The shark starts out small and disadvantaged, but grows over time. Quint starts out undefeatable, but gradually becomes more and more vulnerable.
