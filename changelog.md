#Changelog

##Feb. 22

Started project in Unity from the Jaws Game prototype, no game design changes at this time. 

###Goals

Shark starts weak and tries to evade getting caught until they're confident they will win when it happens. Quint starts off strong, but as the game goes on must play increasingly carefully.

###Problems

Quint has more control over the game at the moment: He can manipulate fish, whereas Shark just eats a fish every turn. Shark needs some sort of ability.
